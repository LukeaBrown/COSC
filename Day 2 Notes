Most specific code first.

String Manipulation:
'str'.format()

  'Hello. My name is {}'.format('LCPL')
  'Hello. My name is LCPL'
  a = 'Albert'
  b = 'today'
  'Hello {}. How are you {}?'.format(a,b)
  'Hello Albert. How are you today?'

While Loops:

(True and False) <----- Must be capitalized like this.
  
  while True:
    print('This will never start')
    
    This will never start
    This will never start
    This will never start
    This will never start
    This will never start
  
Break stops the code even if still true.
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  if i == 3:
    break
  i += 1

Continue skips and continues on until no longer true.
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  if i == 3:
    continue
  i += 1
